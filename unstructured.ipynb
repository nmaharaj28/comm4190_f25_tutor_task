    "### USER\n",
    "I want you to be my tutor. Help me learn latin\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "I'd be happy to help you learn Latin! Let's start with some basics. Would you like to begin with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic pronunciation\n",
    "2. Common greetings and phrases\n",
    "3. Noun cases (nominative, accusative, etc.)\n",
    "4. Present tense verb conjugations\n",
    "5. Numbers and counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Which would you prefer to start with? Also, do you have any prior experience with Latin or other languages? This will help me tailor the lessons to your level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, Latin is a systematic language that requires understanding of grammar concepts, but we can break it down into manageable pieces. Let me know where you'd like to begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I do not have any experience with Latin. Let’s start with basic pronunciation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great choice! Let's start with Latin pronunciation. In Classical Latin, the pronunciation is fairly straightforward as each letter has a consistent sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Vowels:\n",
    "- A = \"ah\" (like in \"father\")\n",
    "- E = \"eh\" (like in \"pet\")\n",
    "- I = \"ee\" (like in \"feet\")\n",
    "- O = \"oh\" (like in \"vote\")\n",
    "- U = \"oo\" (like in \"food\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Consonants are mostly similar to English, but here are some important differences:\n",
    "- C is always hard, like \"k\" (never soft like \"s\")\n",
    "- G is always hard, like in \"go\" (never soft like in \"gentle\")\n",
    "- V is pronounced like our \"w\"\n",
    "- J is pronounced like \"y\" in \"yes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice with some simple words:\n",
    "\n",
    "ROMA (Rome) = ROH-mah\n",
    "VITA (life) = WEE-tah\n",
    "CANIS (dog) = KAH-nis\n",
    "JULIUS = YOO-lee-us\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to practice with these words? Or shall I give you more examples? We can also move on to some simple combinations of sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Let’s practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great! I'll give you some words to practice, and you can try to pronounce them using the rules we just learned. After you try, I can help correct any mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TERRA (earth/land)\n",
    "2. VENI (I came)\n",
    "3. AMICUS (friend)\n",
    "4. JULIUS CAESAR\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you think these are pronounced? Write out how you would say them, and I'll help you with the correct pronunciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I would write TERRA as: TEHR-rah\n",
    "\n",
    "Try writing out how you think the others should sound, and I'll guide you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Terra\n",
    "Weni\n",
    "Amicuz\n",
    "yulius caisar\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Good try! Let's correct these:\n",
    "\n",
    "TERRA - You got this one right! (TEHR-rah)\n",
    "\n",
    "VENI - Close! It's \"WEH-nee\" (remember, 'i' makes an \"ee\" sound)\n",
    "\n",
    "AMICUS - Almost! It's \"AH-mee-kus\" (remember, 'c' is always hard like 'k')\n",
    "\n",
    "JULIUS CAESAR - Close! It's \"YOO-lee-us KAI-sar\" (remember, 'ae' makes an \"ai\" sound like in \"aisle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a few more words to practice these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SILVA (forest)\n",
    "2. CENA (dinner)\n",
    "3. PATER (father)\n",
    "4. VITA (life)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try pronouncing these! Remember:\n",
    "- V sounds like W\n",
    "- C is always hard (K)\n",
    "- A = \"ah\"\n",
    "- E = \"eh\"\n",
    "- I = \"ee\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you pronounce these words?\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Silwa\n",
    "Kena\n",
    "pateer\n",
    "weta\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Let's check these:\n",
    "\n",
    "SILVA - Perfect! \"SEEL-wah\" - You got this exactly right!\n",
    "\n",
    "CENA - Perfect! \"KEH-nah\" - You got the hard 'C' sound correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "PATER - Almost! It's \"PAH-tehr\" (not pa-teer). Remember, 'E' makes an \"eh\" sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "VITA - Almost! It's \"WEE-tah\" (not weh-ta). Remember, 'I' makes an \"ee\" sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're doing really well! The V=W and hard C rules are clearly sticking. Let's practice a few more words focusing on the vowel sounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LIBER (book)\n",
    "2. MATER (mother)\n",
    "3. DEUS (god)\n",
    "4. BONUS (good)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these! Remember:\n",
    "- I = \"ee\"\n",
    "- E = \"eh\"\n",
    "- U = \"oo\"\n",
    "- O = \"oh\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you pronounce these new words?\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Leeber\n",
    "maaateer\n",
    "deeeoos\n",
    "bohnuus\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Let's check these:\n",
    "\n",
    "LIBER - Perfect! \"LEE-behr\" - You got the \"ee\" sound right, but remember 'E' is a shorter \"eh\" sound\n",
    "\n",
    "MATER - Close! It's \"MAH-tehr\" - Remember, 'A' is a clean \"ah\" sound, not stretched out\n",
    "\n",
    "DEUS - Close! It's \"DEH-oos\" - Remember, 'E' is \"eh\" and 'U' is a clean \"oo\" sound\n",
    "\n",
    "BONUS - Almost! It's \"BOH-nus\" - You got the \"oh\" sound right, but remember to keep the 'U' short\n",
    "\n",
    "You're getting better! Let's try some more challenging words that combine these sounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AUDIO (I hear)\n",
    "2. PORTO (I carry)\n",
    "3. DOCEO (I teach)\n",
    "4. SCRIBO (I write)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "- Keep vowels crisp and clean (not stretched out)\n",
    "- O = \"oh\"\n",
    "- E = \"eh\"\n",
    "- I = \"ee\"\n",
    "- U = \"oo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you pronounce these?\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "ajdioooh\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "For AUDIO, it's \"OW-dee-oh\" \n",
    "(The 'au' makes an \"ow\" sound like in \"how\" - I should have explained that diphthong!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try the others:\n",
    "\n",
    "PORTO = \"POHR-toh\"\n",
    "DOCEO = \"DOH-keh-oh\"\n",
    "SCRIBO = \"SKREE-boh\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I realize I should explain diphthongs (two vowels together). In Classical Latin:\n",
    "- AU = \"ow\" (like in \"how\")\n",
    "- AE = \"ai\" (like in \"aisle\")\n",
    "- OE = \"oi\" (like in \"oil\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice these diphthongs with some new words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AUDI (hear!)\n",
    "2. CAESAR (Caesar)\n",
    "3. POENA (punishment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these! And remember the diphthong rules now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "What are diphthongs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "A diphthong is when two vowels combine to make a single sound. Think of how in English \"ou\" makes an \"ow\" sound in \"house\" - that's a diphthong!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Classical Latin, there are three main diphthongs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AE = \"ai\" (like in \"aisle\")\n",
    "Example: CAESAR = \"KAI-sar\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AU = \"ow\" (like in \"how\")\n",
    "Example: AUDIO = \"OW-dee-oh\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. OE = \"oi\" (like in \"oil\")\n",
    "Example: POENA = \"POI-nah\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All other vowel combinations are pronounced separately. For example:\n",
    "- EA in DEA (goddess) = \"DEH-ah\" (not a diphthong)\n",
    "- EO in DEORUM (of the gods) = \"deh-OH-room\" (not a diphthong)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice with these words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AURUM (gold)\n",
    "2. CAELUM (sky)\n",
    "3. PROELIUM (battle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to try pronouncing these words with their diphthongs?\n",

    "prooeelium\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Let's correct these:\n",
    "\n",
    "AURUM - Remember, 'AU' makes an \"ow\" sound, so it's \"OW-room\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CAELUM - Remember, 'AE' makes an \"ai\" sound (like in \"aisle\"), so it's \"KAI-loom\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PROELIUM - Remember, 'OE' makes an \"oi\" sound (like in \"oil\"), so it's \"PROI-lee-oom\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try some more words with diphthongs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LAUDARE (to praise) = \"low-DAH-reh\"\n",

    "\n",
    "PRAEMIUM - Excellent! \"PRAI-mee-oom\" - You got the 'AE' diphthong perfectly!\n",
    "\n",
